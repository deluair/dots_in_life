## Overview

This React application visualizes a 90-year human lifespan as a grid of months. Each dot represents one month:

- **Blue filled dots**: Months you've already lived
- **Empty dots with gray borders**: Future months
- **Orange pulsing dot**: Your current month

The visualization is interactive - adjust your age with the slider to see how your life progresses in months.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by the concept of visualizing life in small units of time (months) to provide perspective on life's finite nature and encourage mindful living.

## Features

- Age slider to adjust your current age
- Visual representation of 90 years broken down into months
- Clear distinction between past, present, and future months
- Responsive layout that works on various screen sizes
